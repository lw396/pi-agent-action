# FAQ

## Triggering

### Why doesn't `@pi` in a comment posted by my workflow start the action?

Events created with a workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not start other workflows; GitHub does this to prevent loops. Post the comment with a GitHub App token or a personal access token instead.

### Why does the action say I don't have permission?

Only users with write access to the repository can trigger it. To let bots trigger it, list them in `allowed_bots`. `allowed_non_write_users` lets other users in, but read [Bash isolation](./security.md#bash-isolation-allowed_non_write_users) first.

### Why doesn't `@pi-bot` trigger it?

The trigger phrase must be a whole word, preceded by whitespace and followed by whitespace or punctuation. `@pi,` and `@pi!` work; `@pi-bot` and `email@pi` do not. Set `trigger_phrase` to use another phrase.

### Can I keep using `@claude`?

Yes: `trigger_phrase: "@claude"`, and `label_trigger: claude` and `branch_prefix: claude/` if you want those too.

### Why can't I assign the bot to an issue in my organization's private repository?

Private organization repositories only accept assignees from the organization. Use `label_trigger` instead, or set `assignee_trigger` to a user account your organization owns.

## Authentication

### Why do I get an OIDC error?

Without `github_token`, the action authenticates as the pi-agent-action app by exchanging the workflow's OIDC token, and the job needs:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
```

Then [install the app](https://github.com/apps/pi-agent-action) on the repository. If you'd rather not use the app, set `github_token`; see [GitHub authentication](../README.md#github-authentication).

### Why are comments posted as `github-actions[bot]` instead of `pi-agent-action[bot]`?

You set `github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, so the action acts as the workflow. Remove `github_token` and grant `id-token: write` to act as the app, or pass your own app's token.

### Why don't the agent's pushes start my CI?

Pushes made with the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not start workflows. Use the pi-agent-action app or your own GitHub App.

## What the agent can and cannot do

### Why does the agent say it can't run my command?

Tool calls other than reads need a rule in `allowed_tools`. Add the command's prefix, e.g. `Bash(npm test:*)`. Commands joined with `&&`, `;` or `|` are refused when a `Bash(...)` rule decides them, so allow each command and let the agent run them separately. See [Letting the agent run commands](./configuration.md#letting-the-agent-run-commands).

### Why won't the agent rebase, merge or force-push?

It only creates commits and pushes them to the branch it works on: the pull request's branch, or a branch it created. The system prompt tells it to decline other git operations even when `allowed_tools` would allow them. Rebase or merge yourself.

### Why doesn't the agent open a pull request?

It pushes a branch and links a prefilled "Create a PR" page in its comment, so you decide whether to open it and branch protection rules still apply.

### Why can't it approve or request changes on a pull request?

The action never submits reviews, so an automated run cannot approve a pull request. It can leave inline comments when `allowed_tools` includes `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment`.

### Why won't it change files under `.github/workflows/`?

The pi-agent-action app has no Workflows permission, so GitHub rejects pushes that change workflows. This is deliberate: a prompt injection could otherwise rewrite your CI.

### Can it see CI results?

Yes, with `actions: read`. See [Reading CI results](./configuration.md#reading-ci-results).

### Why does it update one comment instead of posting several?

Progress and the answer go into a single tracking comment, to keep the thread readable. With `use_sticky_comment: true`, runs started by `pull_request` events also reuse the action's earlier comment on that pull request.

### Can it work across repositories?

No. The app token only covers the repository the workflow runs in.

### Can I add my own MCP servers?

Not yet. Only the action's own GitHub servers are available; see [MCP servers](./configuration.md#mcp-servers).

## Branches and history

### Why did it create a new branch on a closed pull request?

It cannot push to a closed pull request's branch, so it creates a new one, as it does for issues. On an open pull request it pushes to the pull request's branch.

### Why is the git history shallow?

`actions/checkout` fetches one commit by default. On pull requests the action deepens the fetch to cover the pull request's commits. For full history, check out with `fetch-depth: 0`:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
```

## Debugging

### How do I see what the agent did?

- The step summary shows the pi Agent Report when `display_report: true`.
- `show_full_output: true`, or re-running the job with debug logging, prints every pi event in the job log. Tool results can contain sensitive data; use it on private repositories only.
- The `execution_file` output is the full record of the run, with token usage and cost.

### Why do some values in comments show as `[REDACTED]`?

The action redacts known token formats and every environment value of 16 characters or more that is not on its allowlist. To show a long non-secret value, put it in `prompt` instead of `env:`.
